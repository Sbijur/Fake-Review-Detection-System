# Fake-Review-Detection-System Using SVM-LR Model
The project aims to develop a comprehensive system for fake review detection and product recommendation, leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance the user experience on an e-commerce platform. The system begins by scraping reviews from Amazon, a leading online marketplace, to gather data for analysis.

Upon accessing the website, users are presented with detailed product information
along with initial ratings. However, these ratings are subject to refinement through a machine
learning algorithm designed to identify and filter out fake reviews.
